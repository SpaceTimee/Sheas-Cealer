## About
**Sheas Cealer Nix**: A SNI concealing tool based on **Avalonia(.Net8)**

* Applicable platform: Linux & Windows (MacOS to be supported) (Windows users are recommended to use original [Sheas Cealer](https://github.com/SpaceTimee/Sheas-Cealer))

## Vocabulary
**[Sheas Cealer Dictionary](https://github.com/SpaceTimee/Sheas-Cealer/wiki/Sheas-Cealer-Dictionary)**

## Notes
1. The Built-in Cealing Host is continuously updated in the [Cealing Host repository](https://github.com/SpaceTimee/Cealing-Host)
2. When Sheas Cealer Nix is updated, it will not overwrite the existing configs. If you need to synchronize with the upstream, you need to click the **Update Upstream Host** button, or **manually overwrite**
3. This project and all its resources are for the sole purpose of **defending against illegal network monitoring** and **conducting network security research**, and are not intended to bypass the censorship of any country
4. Sheas Cealer Nix is still in the **development stage**, but each production version will be **stable and available** before release
5. Github Release will retain **all versions** that can be used currently, but it is strongly recommended to use the **latest version**
6. Note 3 will be officially and strictly implemented from 2024.12.31

## Download
Github: [https://github.com/Project-SheasCealerNix/Sheas-Cealer-Nix/releases](https://github.com/Project-SheasCealerNix/Sheas-Cealer-Nix/releases)

## Installation
1. Setup Installer (preferred): Download Sheas Cealer Setup.exe and run -> Then follow the prompts to install
2. Zip Package (installation-free): Download Sheas Cealer Zip.zip and unzip -> Then you can use it directly

> Scd version: The Scd version has a built-in .Net runtime and can run in an environment without a .Net runtime, but the cost is a larger file size and worse cross-platform capabilities. If there is no special reason, it is not recommended to use the Scd version
